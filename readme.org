** Viewing bulkdata
If you have successfully exported your cache2 files into an SQLite3
database then you can view them in dogma-editor.  See [[*Searching bulkdata][Searching bulkdata]]
for caveats.

** Searching bulkdata
Each bulkdata recordset allows you to search, however for some sets
it will not work.  The code generation for dogma editor looks for a 'name'
or 'Name' for the record fields.  If it doesn't find one, searching will be
disabled. In most cases, dogma-editor will indicate if a recordset is searchable
or not

** Editing bulkdata
When viewing a record, all of the values should be editable.  When you're done
making changes mark the record as dirty.
